# Dnd Token Tra

I often run into problems with initiative rolls and turn order when playing DND. All the applications that I tried seemed not convenient to me and I wanted to try to create my own such application. I finished it with the bare minimum of features. 

It supports:
Quick addition of tokens, characters. 
Sort by initiative.
HP Dice Selection
Removal from the field
Taking damage

In the plans:
Improving styling with css
Creating a database with characters
More flexible add character menu
Page parser from MonsterManual or screenshot
DB with monsters

Well... Overall, I'm planning this as a big dnd helper that can make the game easier to play. For example procedural generation of events with history. World Event Tracking Timers for the guards walking through the crypt, labyrinth or somewhere else If you have any ideas what to add - write! I will be glad to ideas


Oh and it`s full RUS i will add ENG support later
